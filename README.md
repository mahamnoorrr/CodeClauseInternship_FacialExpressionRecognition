Facial Expression Recognition:
This project is part of my internship with CodeClause, where I'm working on building a Facial Expression Recognition system using deep learning. 
The system can detect and classify different facial expressions—such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more—from images, 
enabling real-time emotion recognition.

Project Overview:
The goal is to create a model capable of recognizing emotions based on facial features. This is achieved by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 
with the JAFFE (Japanese Female Facial Expression) dataset for training. The model can classify images into various emotions based on facial expressions.

Technologies Used:
Python: Main programming language for data handling, training, and prediction.
TensorFlow / Keras: For building and training the CNN model.
OpenCV: For image processing and handling user-provided images.
Matplotlib: For displaying images and visualizing results.

Key Features:
Image-based Emotion Detection: Users can provide an image, and the model will identify the facial expression shown.
Real-time Feedback: Outputs the detected emotion for the user, helping applications understand human emotions more effectively.
Why This Project is Helpful
Facial Expression Recognition has a wide range of applications, such as in social robotics, security, customer service, and mental health monitoring. 
By using deep learning to understand emotions, this project can contribute to enhancing user interactions with AI systems, making them more responsive and empathetic.
